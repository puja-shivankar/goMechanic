However, the cleaning job sucked, internal areas had marks and stains they promised would be completely gone after the cleaning, but did not. Although they were kind enough to ask me to stop by again to get those stains removed for no charge, my rating is for the hassle it caused. Else the Auto Pro guy named Vikram has been extremely professional, kept me updated timely about the status of my vehicle and the work done etc. Trustworthy people, I would take my vehicle

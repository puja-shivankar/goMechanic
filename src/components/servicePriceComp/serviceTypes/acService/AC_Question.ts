        quetion: "When should I get the AC system on my car recharged?",
        answer: `Ideally, you should get the AC on your car serviced at least once a year or when you feel that the AC is not cooling as it used to.
           Simple enough! If you start noticing the AC isnâ€™t reaching the optimum cooling temperature, have your system inspected. In most situations, 
          the car is diagnosed with low or leaking AC gas.`,

        quetion: "Why is the AC system on my car making noises?",
        answer: `Aside from the discomfort, a noisy air conditioner may cause you, 
          it is also a good indication that you should get your system checked. 
          Loud noises coming from the AC in your car can stem from a variety of issues such as a clogged evaporator coil or a faulty compressor.`,

        quetion: "Why is my car AC blowing out hot air?",
        answer: `A car AC blowing out hot air can be due to low refrigerant level or due to a problem in the condenser, the compressor, the cooling fan, or the electrical system of your car. 
          It can also be a restricted condenser coil. In such a case, it is highly advised to get your car thoroughly inspected at the nearest GoMechanic workshop in Pune .`,

        quetion: "Why does my car AC smell bad or musty??",
        answer: `If you are noticing mildew or mouldy smell coming from your car AC system, this is a good indication that some component in your AC (often the filter or drain line) is dirty and clogged. 
          This can also be attributed to excess moisture from the AC.
           For such problems, we highly suggest a professional AC cleaning service.`,

      {
        id: "panel5",
        quetion: "Why is my car AC not blowing air properly?",
        answer: `Low airflow from the AC blower can be an issue with the evaporator coil
           (inside cooling coil) or a dirty air filter, clogged drainpipe, or a broken fan blower inside your car AC vent. To avoid further deterioration, we highly advise you to get 
          your car AC thoroughly diagnosed at the nearest GoMechanic workshop in Pune`,

        quetion: "What happens during a routine car AC service?",
        answer: `A comprehensive car AC service deals with a myriad of things including dust and dirt build-up in the cooling coil, HVAC filter or the blower fan. 
          The service also covers AC gas recharging and high/low-pressure test, compressor oil replacement, condenser cleaning and more on your car. Visit your nearest GoMechanic workshop in Pune to know more.
